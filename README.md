# Gini-Privacy-Policy
Gini Bot Privacy Policy

Thank you for choosing Gini! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle the collection, use, and protection of your data when you use Gini. By using the bot, you agree to the terms outlined here.

Data Collection

Gini is a free-to-use service and does not require any payments. However, certain data is collected to enable and improve the service. The types of data we collect include:

Server IDs: We collect server IDs to configure features such as automated roles, anti-nuke systems, welcome messages, and giveaways. This data is securely stored and encrypted using AES standards.
How We Use Data

Your data is used strictly for providing and improving Gini’s services. We do not share or sell your information to any third parties. Any terms in this Privacy Policy follow our Terms of Service unless otherwise stated.

Message Monitoring

Gini monitors server messages to enforce automated moderation tools like automod, blacklist protection, anti-nuke actions, and role assignments. This monitoring ensures a safe and pleasant environment across Discord servers.

Access to Data

Only server owners and administrators have access to their server's data. Gini's developers may also access this data for maintenance and development purposes to enhance the bot’s functionality.

Data Storage and Retention

Server data, including configurations and blacklisted user IDs, is stored for up to 7 days after Gini is removed from a Discord server. This allows for quick reconfiguration if the bot is re-added within that time. If you would like to have your data permanently deleted, you can request it directly from the developer.

Contact Information

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, feel free to reach out via our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/Gini).

Thank you for trusting Gini with your data. We are dedicated to ensuring your privacy and providing a secure experience!
